# Implement solutions that use Azure Event Grid
Azure Event Grid is a fully-managed event routing service.

### Key concepts
* Event - what happened;
* Event source - where the event took place. <br/>
  For example: Azure Blob, Azure Subscription (when something happened to a subscription) and many other Azure and non Azure services;
* Topic - the endpoint where publishers send events;
* Event subscription - the endpoint or built-in mechanism to route events, sometimes to more than one hander;
